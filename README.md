# Haml-rs

This aims to be a library and CLI application that can parse [Haml](http://haml.info).

Note that this is very early stage software and does not even work fully yet (though we are getting close). Once we are able to actually generate HTML from basic Haml I will increment to version 0.1.0 but until then this isn't even ready for that. Once we hit 0.1.0 then I will publish to crates.io as well but there is no point in putting up code that doesn't work.
