# Haml-rs

[![](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/hamlrs.svg?maxAge=25920)](https://crates.io/crates/hamlrs) ![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jhartwell/haml-rs.svg?branch=master)

This is a library and CLI for parsing [Haml](http://haml.info/) templates. You are able to get Haml-rs on [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/hamlrs). The aim for this is to produce identical HTML to what the Ruby [Haml gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/haml) produces.

## Usage

To include haml-rs in your project add the following to your Cargo.toml:

```
[dependencies]
hamlrs = "0.3.0"
```
Then add the following to your code:

```rust
extern crate haml;
```
## Example

#### Library
```rust
extern crate haml;

fn main() {
    let test_haml = "%span";
    let html = haml::to_html(&test_haml);
}
```

### Stability

This software is in its early stages and as such there may be issues with stability.

If you find any bugs please don't hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/jhartwell/haml-rs/issues) on github or, if you want, you can reach out directly to me at jon@dontbreakthebuild.com


## Integration tests

There are currently a few integration tests (and more to come). If you are going to contribute to an integration test please make sure that the HTML file that is generated by the Ruby [Haml gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/haml) so that we can ensure that we are producing the same output as the reference implementation.

## Current limitations

There is no variable/expression support in Haml-rs. This is something that is being thought about and if you want to add your thoughts you are more than welcome to comment [here](https://github.com/jhartwell/haml-rs/issues/6).
