Version 0.4.2
-------
Fixed bug where periods in text would cause parse failure as it was trying to parse as a class. Text with period now properly generates

Version 0.4.1
-------
Fixed bug with comments not being outputted in the resulting HTML

Version 0.4.0
-------
Removed CLI from library project. The crate for the CLI is now https://crates.io/crates/hamlrs-cli

Version 0.3.0
-------
Features:
    * CLI
        - The CLI application now supports pretty-printing an AST of a Haml file. You can do this by running hamlrs ast input.haml
    * Library
        - Added Ruby style attributes with dictionary syntax 
        - Added to_ast function in the haml module so it is possible to generate both AST or HTML from the library
        - Attributes are now ordered similar to how the Ruby version of Haml does 

Bug Fixes:
    * Fixed various issues with improper nesting of elements. There were cases where nested elements would be put under the root element.
    * Fixed issue where empty lines caused the parser to stop parsing. This was causing documents to only generate half of what they should
    

Version 0.2.0
-------
Breaking Changes:
    Public:
        * The Haml struct has been removed from the haml module. Instead of exporting the struct there is now just the to_html function
        that is exported
    Private:
        * The Generator struct from the generator module has been removed. Instead of exporting the struct there is now just the to_html function
        that is exported
Bug Fixes:
    * Fixed Windows support and tested on Windows machine.
Features:
    * Added platform dependent newline support. On Windows machines, the HTML will generate with CRLF and on non-Windows machines
    the newline will be a LF.
